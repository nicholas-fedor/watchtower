## Overview

The Watchtower documentation website serves as the central hub for user guides, configuration references, and advanced feature documentation.
The site is statically generated and supports multiple versions to accommodate different Watchtower releases.

This is enabled by the use of several key components including:

- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: Static site generator with Material theme
- **[Mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike)**: Version management for documentation
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**: Automated build and deployment pipelines

**Customizations**:

- Can be fine-tuned or disabled for debugging by modifying plugin configuration in `mkdocs.yaml`.

### Dependencies

Python dependencies are managed in `build/mkdocs/docs-requirements.txt`:

- **`mkdocs`**:
  - Core static site generator that processes Markdown files and generates HTML documentation sites.
  - Version handling follows semantic versioning with regular updates for security patches and new features. Critical for the entire documentation pipeline.

- **`mkdocs-material`**:
  - Material Design theme providing modern, responsive UI components and extensive customization options.
  - Version must be aligned with MkDocs to ensure compatibility; typically updated alongside MkDocs major releases.

- **`md-toc`**:
  - Generates table of contents for Markdown files, enhancing navigation within documentation pages.
  - Version stability is important to maintain consistent TOC formatting across all pages.

- **`mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`**:
  - Plugin that displays localized "last updated" timestamps on documentation pages.
  - Depends on Git repository access and full commit history
  - Version updates should be tested for localization and date formatting changes.

- **`mkdocs-minify-plugin`**:
  - Minifies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML assets to reduce file sizes and improve page load performance.
  - Optional dependency that should be verified for compatibility with theme customizations and other plugins.

## Mike Versioning

**Quick Navigation:**

- [Mike's Purpose](#mikes-purpose)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Using Mike Locally](#using-mike-locally)
- [Version Management](#mike-version-management)
  - [Version Types](#version-types)
  - [Alias System](#alias-system)
- [Deployment Strategy](#deployment-strategy)

### Mike's Purpose

Mike enables versioned documentation, allowing users to access documentation specific to their Watchtower version.
 This is crucial for maintaining accurate references across different releases.

### Configuration

Mike is configured in `build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml` with:

- Version selector enabled
- CSS directory for custom styling
- Redirect-based alias handling

### Usage

#### Using Mike Locally

To use Mike for local development and testing of versioned documentation:

1. **Install Mike**:

   Install Mike using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install mike
   ```

2. **Configuration**:

   Ensure Mike is configured in your `mkdocs.yml` file. The plugin should be added to the plugins list:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - mike:
         version_selector: true
         css_dir: assets/styles
         alias_type: redirect
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This configuration is already present in `build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml`. The `alias_type: redirect` creates HTML redirects for version aliases, which is suitable for static hosting.

3. **Build and Deploy Locally**:

     To build the documentation and commit the built files to a local Git branch (e.g., gh-pages) without pushing to a remote repository:

     ```bash
     mike deploy <version> --config-file build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml
     ```

     Replace `<version>` with the desired version identifier (e.g., `1.0.0`, `dev`). You can also specify aliases:

     ```bash
     mike deploy <version> <alias> --config-file build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml
     ```

     Use `--update-aliases` to move an alias from another version if needed.

     > [!NOTE]
     > `mike deploy` commits changes locally by default. To push to a remote repository, add the `--push` flag.

4. **Serve Multiple Versions Locally**:

   To serve all deployed versions locally for testing version switching and navigation:

   ```bash
   mike serve --config-file build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This serves documentation from the deployed Git branch, so you must run `mike deploy` first to include your changes in the versioned site.

5. **Serve Single Version Locally**:

   For quick previews during development without versioning features:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve --config-file build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml
   ```

   This serves the current documentation state without requiring deployment commits.

This setup allows you to develop with `mkdocs serve`, deploy versions locally with `mike deploy`, and test the full versioned site with `mike serve` before pushing changes.

### Mike Version Management

#### Version Types

- **Latest**: Points to the most recent stable release
- **Dev**: Development version built from main branch
- **Tagged Releases**: Specific version tags (e.g., v1.2.3)

#### Alias System

- `latest` alias automatically updates to point to new releases
- Version-specific aliases for direct access to historical docs

### Deployment Strategy

Versions are deployed automatically via GitHub Actions:

- Release events create new versioned documentation
- Main branch pushes update the `dev` version
- Aliases are managed to ensure `latest` always points to the newest release

### WASM Template Preview Overview

- The WASM template preview provides an interactive way for users to test notification templates directly in the browser.
- This feature allows real-time rendering of templates with different container states and log levels.

### Implementation

#### Core Components

- `tools/tplprev/main_wasm.go`: WebAssembly build target for browser execution
- `tools/tplprev/main.go`: CLI version for local testing
- `scripts/build-tplprev.sh`: Build script for WASM compilation

#### Build Process

1. Compiles Go code to WebAssembly using `GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js`
2. Copies `wasm_exec.js` from Go installation or downloads from GitHub
3. Outputs `tplprev.wasm` and `wasm_exec.js` to `docs/assets/`

#### JavaScript Integration

The WASM module exposes a `WATCHTOWER.tplprev` function that accepts:

- Template string
- Array of container states (scanned, updated, failed, etc.)
- Array of log levels (fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace)

#### States and Levels

- **States**: Scanned (c), Updated (u), Failed (e), Skipped (k), Stale (t), Fresh (f)
- **Levels**: Fatal (f), Error (e), Warn (w), Info (i), Debug (d), Trace (t)

### Usage in Documentation

The template preview is integrated into `docs/notifications/template-preview/index.md` with:

- Interactive HTML form
- JavaScript for WASM execution
- CSS styling for the preview interface

    ```

### Production Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions. Manual deployment can be triggered through the Actions tab in the repository.

**For Maintainers**:

- Documentation changes are deployed on merge to main
- New releases automatically create versioned docs
- Version aliases are managed automatically
- Manual deployments can be triggered for testing

### Version Management (Deployment)

**Creating New Versions**:

1. Create a GitHub release with appropriate tag
2. The `publish-docs.yaml` workflow will automatically deploy the version
3. Update `latest` alias to point to the new release

**Managing Aliases**:

- `latest` is automatically managed by the deployment workflow
- Custom aliases can be set using Mike commands locally for testing

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

- **WASM Build Failures**: Ensure Go version matches CI (1.25.x)
- **Missing Dependencies**: Clear pip cache and reinstall
- **Version Conflicts**: Check Mike version aliases with `mike list`

#### Validation

- Use `mkdocs build --config-file build/mkdocs/mkdocs.yaml` for local validation
- Check link validation warnings in build output
- Verify WASM functionality in browser developer console
