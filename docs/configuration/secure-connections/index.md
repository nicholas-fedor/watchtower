# Secure Connections

Watchtower is also capable of connecting to Docker endpoints which are protected by SSL/TLS.

If you've used `docker-machine` to provision your remote Docker host, you simply need to volume mount the certificates generated by _docker-machine_ into the Watchtower container and optionally specify `--tlsverify` flag.

The `docker-machine` certificates for a particular host can be located by executing the `docker-machine env` command for the desired host (note the values for the `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variables that are returned from this command).

The directory containing the certificates for the remote host needs to be mounted into the Watchtower container at `/etc/ssl/docker`.

With the certificates mounted into the Watchtower container you need to specify the `--tlsverify` flag to enable verification of the certificate:

=== "Docker CLI"

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
    --name watchtower \
    -e DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST \
    -e DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/docker \
    -v $DOCKER_CERT_PATH:/etc/ssl/docker \
    --restart unless-stopped
    nickfedor/watchtower --tlsverify
    ```

=== "Docker Compose"

    ```yaml
    services:
      watchtower:
        image: nickfedor/watchtower
        environment:
        - DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST
        - DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/docker
        - DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=true
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ```
