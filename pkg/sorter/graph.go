// DependencyGraph is the dependency graph of a set of containers, with every
// container's links resolved once when the graph is built.
//
// Links are matched to containers as SortByDependencies matches them,
// including Compose service names, replica names, container-name aliases, and
// Docker IDs. Sorting a subset of the containers keeps only the dependencies
// between the containers in the subset, so a link always names the same
// container whichever subset is sorted, and a subset of containers outside
// every cycle always sorts.
//
// Watchtower containers are not part of the graph and are always sorted last,
// but the graph still records which containers depend on them, and which
// containers they depend on, for Dependents. A link that names an unmonitored
// container exactly resolves to nothing, rather than to a different container
// with a similar name.
//
// A graph reflects the labels and host config of its containers when it is
// built. Build a new graph after they change.

//
// Watchtower containers are set aside, as SortByDependencies sets them aside,
// so links never resolve to them for ordering. Their own links still resolve,
// and a link that names one exactly by name, identifier, or ID, or without its
// replica number when it is the only such Watchtower container and no
// unmonitored container has that name, makes the linking container one of its
// dependents.
//
// Unmonitored containers are not part of the graph. A link that names one
// exactly resolves to nothing, so it is not matched to a monitored container
// instead.
//
// Parameters:
//   - log: Process logger.
//   - containers: Monitored containers to build the graph of.
//   - unmonitored: Other containers that links may name.
//   - useComposeDependsOn: Whether to include Compose depends_on labels as links.
//
// Returns:
//   - *DependencyGraph: The graph.
//   - error: An IdentifierCollisionError when monitored containers other than
//     Watchtower containers share an identifier.
